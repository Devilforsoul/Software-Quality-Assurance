  Before attend the class i only knew a little about the Software Quality Assurance. 
  After reading the teacher's courseware for Software Quality Assurance gives a new understanding for me. 
  Courseware 1 is a brief description of many aspects of Software Quality Assurance:different roles in software management,
  software management, product types, etc.. 
  Courseware 2 mainly lists the techniques which the Software Quality Assurance is needed  test technology,
  professional statistics, modeling, analysis technique.
  Courseware 3 gives a brief definition of what is a good quality management from different aspects.
  
  I think SQA is more and more important for the companies.
  It can clears the responsibilities of management and adjust the structure of whole company or organization.
  Also,it can documents the programs and gives the company a lot of clear quantitative indicators.
  Finally,SQA is the soul of a software product.It determines the success of a product.
  
  I wish Mr.Tian can teach our more technology about SQA !
